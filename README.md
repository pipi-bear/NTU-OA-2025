Optimization Algorithms
</h1>

---

This repo contains the HW when I was taking the course ***Optimization Algorithms* (Spring, 2025)** @NTU CSIE, conducted by prof. Yen-Huan Li.

Check the following descriptions for the usage of the files in each HW subdirectory.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that I did not get high grades for this course, so be careful when referring to my HW.

Hope that people who checked my repo can get better grades than mine :joy:

If there's any problem, feel free to reach me by posting an issue or find me from the "contact me" section on my profile.

## Directory Structure

In each `HW*`, we have:

---

- `hw*.pdf`: HW spec.
- `r13922136_HW*.pdf`: HW file that I handed in.
> You could also find the `.tex` file with the same file name.
- `/HW*_feedback`: A subdirectory that contains the feedback I received, including the points deducted and some explanations. 
> :warning: Note that both `HW1` and `HW2` contain two feedback files, if you only check one, some of the solutions have flaws but are not marked!
- `/HW*_images`: A subdirectory that includes the images that I attached in the HW file.

In `HW2`, there is another subdirectory `/references`, which contains some notes that I found useful and referenced in my HW.

The following tree graph shows the main files and the subdirectories for the three HWs.
